# About this Battle Computer
Pay no attention to Lord Southburgh hacking away on his M2 MacBook Air as he sits on the floor of the Kontor. That's not me. Ignore him as he sits behind the curtain on a pile of React books on permanent loan from the university and cussing like a sailor.

I am Not Lord Southburgh and I have put together this battle calculator based on the fine work of these pioneers:

**Based on these battle calculators:**
* https://parpio-battle.github.io/parpio-battle/ - The empire's Computation and Science department thanks you for your brave work in accurately simulating a battle, and serves notice that it is now siezing the same.
* https://galefury.github.io/parpio-battle/ - The empire thanks you for the ideas and the knowledge that your version has now provided.
* https://andyhazz.github.io/parpio-battle/ - Links to unit graphics acquired for the empire.

Thank You! Your work will be rewarded with the opportunity to aid in building the palace!

# How to use

I put instructions on the page, but if in doubt just click things.

# Some facts about it

I wanted to learn a bit more about the battle system underneath, to make it easier to plan a battle without just guessing or throwing it at the optimiser. 
I did it to learn React, Tailwind, Genetic Algorithms and Recoil.
